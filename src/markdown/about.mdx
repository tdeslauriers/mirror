I wanted a place to host pictures of/for my family and friends since I don't post photos of us on social media generally.
Over the years, the site has become my Frankenstein's monster or as a friend said,
_"the most over-engineered image-server of all time."_

When I want to learn about coding languages, frameworks, design-patterns, etc.,
I will read and/or take a course, and then get practical experience by designing new features or rebuilding a
component herein. The site began as an **AngularJS** learning project, was rebuilt as a **Spring Boot** monolith,
rebuilt again as a **Spring Cloud** microservice cluster, and again to a **Micronaut** cluster with a **ReactJS** frontend,
and now is a **NextJS** site supported by **Go** micro-services hosted in **Kubernetes** (... so far).

Finally, this site represents a body of work, serving
as validation of [my resume](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomdeslauriers/).
