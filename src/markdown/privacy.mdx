## Colleciton and Use of Personal Information

When you register, I ask for:

- Your email address
- Your first and last name
- (Optional) Your date of birth
  - Used by the allowance application and for birthday reminders—because, let’s be honest, I’ll never remember otherwise.

This information is used to create your user account's basic functionality.

In your profile, you may (but don’t have to) enter other details like your address, phone number,
or other personal info. **You have full control over your profile data** — you can review, update, or remove it anytime.
The only reason this even exists is so I can practice proper data management and operations.
I promise I’m not selling your phone number to cold-callers or plotting to take over the world with your ZIP code.

This site is primarily for educational purposes (mine) and as a place to share photos with family and friends.
I don’t use your personal information for anything beyond that. In fact, for the most part, I don’t even look at it.

## Cookies

The site uses cookies for things like session management, and also to keep track of user preferences.  
I don’t use them for tracking, advertising, or anything creepy because that's gross.

## Sharing of Personal Information

I don’t share your personal information with anyone. Period.

## Security of your Personal Information

Your data is **encrypted**, and only you and I (the site owner) can access it. I take security seriously because:

1. It's my profession and I have big feelings about it.
2. I don’t want my relatives yelling at me...

However, here’s something to understand about encryption:

- When a website says your data is "encrypted," that doesn’t mean it’s invisible to the company running the site.
- Admins and authorized users can still see your data: always. Encryption exists to prevent unauthorized access.

No system is 100% secure, and modern technology is complex. Mistakes happen, and data leaks are possible.
So, always be mindful about what you share online: here or anywhere else.

## Right to be Forgotten

If you ever want your data removed or your account deleted, let me know, and I’ll take care of it right away.
