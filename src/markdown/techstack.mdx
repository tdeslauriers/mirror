## Front End:

### User Interface/Experience (UI/UX)

**Service Name**: [mirror](https://github.com/tdeslauriers/mirror) — a reference to Galadriel's
mirror in J.R.R. Tolkien's _The Lord of the Rings_, which shows each person who views it something different.

**Description**: [mirror](https://github.com/tdeslauriers/mirror) is a NextJS
application written in TypeScript using NextJS's App Router pattern. In short, this is the part
of the application that you can see and interact with directly.

## Service Layer:

The over-arching theme in these serivces is to use as few third party libraries as possible.
I spent the first half of my career using **Java** frameworks like **Spring Boot** and **Micronaut**,
which are very powerful and do a lot of things for you out of the box. My goal for this
iteration of my services is to learn to do what those frameworks do for you, such as web calls and retries,
persistance repositories, authentication, encryption, etc. To this end, I have written a stripped
down version of a web framework called [carapace](https://github.com/tdeslauriers/carapace) (because “_exoskeleton_“ was taken) to
provide reusable components, functions, and models for my services below. Also in [carapace](https://github.com/tdeslauriers/carapace) ,
I am slwoly building up CLI code/tools to perform tedious support and DevOps activities like cert rotation.

### Service-to-Service Authentication (s2s)

**Service Name**: [ran](https://github.com/tdeslauriers/ran) — rán (燃) is the name of one of two twin dragons
in _Avatar: The Last Airbender_. Ran (燃) means "burn" or "ignite" in Mandarin, and since all services
need to get service credentials before talking to any other action, the ignite side of the dragon pair
seemed appropriate.

**Description**: [ran](https://github.com/tdeslauriers/ran) is an application written in **Go**,
utilizing my [carapace](https://github.com/tdeslauriers/carapace) project for core microservice functionality.
It provides service-to-service (s2s) authentication and authorization to the rest of the services in the cluster.
It mints s2s JWT tokens and it is the source truth of for JWT scopes in both auth services
(simply because the scopes table existed in this service first).

### Identity (iam)

**Service Name**: [shaw](https://github.com/tdeslauriers/shaw) — shaw, or more correctly: shāo (燒), means "burn"
or "blaze" in Mandarin, and is the second of two twin dragons in _Avatar: The Last Airbender_.

**Description**: [shaw](https://github.com/tdeslauriers/shaw) is an application written in **Go**,
utilizing my [carapace](https://github.com/tdeslauriers/carapace) project for core microservice
functionality. It is the service counterpart to [ran](https://github.com/tdeslauriers/ran), providing user
authentication and authorization. It mints user JWT tokens and it is the source of truth for user identity,
though it does not contain all of a user's profile information.

### Gateway

**Service**: [erebor](https://github.com/tdeslauriers/erebor) — erebor is the proper name of The Lonely Mountain
from J.R.R. Tolkien's _The Hobbit_. It is where Smaug is sitting on his mound of treasure, i.e.,
this gateway will give access to the site's restricted content. Also, in the story, Erebor had a
Great Main Gate so I thought it fit.

**Description**: [erebor](https://github.com/tdeslauriers/erebor) is an application written in **Go**,
utilizing my [carapace](https://github.com/tdeslauriers/carapace) project for core microservice functionality.
It provides the main entry point to the website's backend functionality and restricted content.
It is more than a reverse proxy however, it manages user sessions, Oauth2 exchange flow, and JWT tokens.
Also, it assembles composite data from multiple services. It can be thought of as the site's primary service,
or hub, with the other support services coming off of it like spokes.

## Persistance Layer:

All of the service layer applications persist data to **MariaDB** databases behind the scenes.

## Infrastructure:

All of the service applications run in **Docker** containers, hosted in a
**Kubernetes (k8s)** cluster running on various old, busted computers at my house.
